Introduction

Our project is a Task Planner designed to help students like us stay organized and manage our time better. It lets you list your tasks, set deadlines, and keep track of what needs to be done. The goal is to make planning easier and less stressful, so it’s not overwhelming when you have a lot on your plate. It’s a simple way to stay focused and avoid falling behind.

Problem Statement

Many students, including ourself, often feel overwhelmed trying to balance school, homework, personal life, and other responsibilities. It’s easy to lose track of deadlines, forget important tasks, or leave things until the last minute. This creates a lot of unnecessary stress and can hurt our grades and overall well-being. The real issue is that we don’t always have a simple, reliable way to organize everything in one place. Our Task Planner aims to solve this by offering an easy-to-use tool that helps students plan their days, set priorities, and keep track of tasks. By staying organized, we can reduce stress, avoid procrastination, and feel more in control. This kind of tool is especially important for building good habits and managing time better in the long run.

Objectives

The goal of our project is to help students stay organized and manage their tasks with less stress. It’s designed to improve time management, encourage better planning habits, and make handling schoolwork feel easier and more manageable.
